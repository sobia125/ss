 <p>Anyway, I was in Pakistan recently and started craving this biryani. Call me crazy, but I decided to make a huge amount for my entire family. And by some miracle, the biryani turned out amazing. Everyone was obsessed with it, especially my uncle, who said this was the first time he had eaten biryani in Punjab that didn't taste like pulao.</p>

    <p>METHOD WITH PHOTOS

        Detailed instructions are provided in the recipe box at the bottom of this post, but let's go over the steps with photos to help you visualize everything:
        
        First, go ahead and prep all the ingredients so they are ready to go:</p>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a beloved dish with many variations. Here's a breakdown of the key steps and ingredients, drawing from reliable sources:   

    </p>
   <p><ul>Marinade:
    <li>Yogurt is a base, providing tenderness.   
    <li> Ginger-garlic paste is essential for flavor.   
        <li> A blend of spices: garam masala, turmeric, chili powder, and often biryani masala.   
            <li> Lemon juice adds brightness</li></ul></p>
            <p><ul>Rice:
               <li> Basmati rice is the traditional choice, known for its long grains and aroma.   
               <li> Parboiling the rice is crucial for achieving the right texture.</li></ul></p>
               <p><ul>Chicken:
                <li>Bone-in chicken pieces are often preferred for their rich flavor.   
                    <li>The chicken is cooked in a flavorful gravy.
                   
                </ul></p> 
                <p><ul>Onions:
                   <li> Caramelized or fried onions are a key element, adding sweetness and depth.
                    <p><ul>Fresh Herbs:
                       <li>Mint and cilantro add freshness and vibrancy.</ul></p>
                     </ul></p>
                     <p><ul><li>General Steps:

                        Marinating the Chicken:
                        Combine the marinade ingredients and coat the chicken thoroughly.   
                        Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or longer for more intense flavorPreparing the Rice:
                        Rinse and soak the basmati rice.   
                        Parboil the rice with whole spices until it's partially cooked.
                        Cooking the Chicken Gravy:
                        Fry the onions until golden brown.
                        Add the marinated chicken and cook until it's tender.
                        Add other needed spices and cook until a thick gravy is formed.
                        Layering and "Dum" Cooking:
                        Layer the chicken gravy and parboiled rice in a pot.
                        Garnish with fried onions, saffron-infused milk, and fresh herbs.   
                        Seal the pot tightly and cook on low heat ("dum") to allow the flavors to meld.   
                        Serving:
                        Gently fluff the biryani and serve hot.
                        Important Tips:
                        
                        Use high-quality basmati rice.
                        Don't overcook the rice during parboiling.
                        The "dum" cooking is essential for the biryani's signature flavor.
                        Allow the biryani to rest for a few minutes before serving.

Place the heavy-bottomed pot on the smallest burner on the lowest heat setting with weight on top, and cook until steam rises through the rice. Then go ahead and very gently mix the biryani (you don't want to mix it all the way, just give it a few flips):</p>
